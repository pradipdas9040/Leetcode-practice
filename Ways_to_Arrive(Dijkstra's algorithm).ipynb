    "You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with bi-directional roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.\n",

You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the shortest amount of time.\n",
